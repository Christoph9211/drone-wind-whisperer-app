# Current Limitations and Future Enhancements

## API Limitations

### Gust Data

The National Weather Service API does not provide wind gust data in the hourly forecast endpoint. This limits the application's ability to accurately assess gust-related safety risks.

Potential solutions:
- Explore alternative endpoints that might include gust data
- Consider integrating with additional weather APIs that provide this information
- The application now includes an integration with the free Open-Meteo API to
  retrieve gust forecasts when NWS data lacks this field
- Implement estimation algorithms to predict gust behavior based on steady wind patterns

### Geographic Coverage

The NWS API only covers the United States. For international users, the application would need to integrate with additional weather data providers.

## Technical Limitations

### Data Refresh Rate

The application currently refreshes data every 30 minutes. While this is sufficient for most use cases, real-time operations might benefit from more frequent updates.

### Mock Data Implementation

Although the application includes comments for mock data as a fallback, a robust mock data generator is not fully implemented. This could improve the offline experience and testing capabilities.

### Error Recovery

While the application handles API errors, it could implement more sophisticated recovery mechanisms, such as:
- Exponential backoff for retry attempts
- Partial data updates when only some endpoints fail
- Better offline support through caching

## Feature Enhancements

### Weather Visualization

The application could be enhanced with additional weather visualization features:
- Wind direction indicators using vector graphics
- Weather condition icons (rain, snow, clear, etc.)
- Visualization of forecast confidence levels

### Advanced Analysis

Potential advanced analysis features include:
- Wind shear detection and warning
- Turbulence prediction based on terrain and weather patterns
- Flight time optimization based on wind conditions

### User Experience

Potential UX improvements:
- User accounts to save favorite locations
- Notification system for unsafe wind conditions
- Export options for reports and data
- Historical data analysis and trends
- Mobile app conversion for on-the-field use

### Machine Learning Integration

Longer-term enhancements could include machine learning components:
- Predictive safety models based on historical data
- Anomaly detection for unusual wind patterns
- Custom safety threshold recommendations based on drone specifications

## Daylight Hours Definition

The application currently defines daylight hours as 6am to 8pm. This is a simplified approach that does not account for:
- Seasonal variations in sunrise/sunset times
- Geographic variations based on latitude
- Official civil twilight definitions

A more accurate approach would utilize sunrise and sunset calculations based on the location's coordinates and the current date.

## Wind Model Refinement

The power law model used for estimating wind speeds at different altitudes is a simplified model. More sophisticated models could account for:
- Atmospheric stability conditions
- Terrain roughness variations
- Time-of-day effects on wind profiles
- Urban vs. rural environments

## International Support

To better serve international users, future enhancements could include:
- Multiple language support
- Integration with international weather data providers
- Support for different unit systems beyond metric and imperial
